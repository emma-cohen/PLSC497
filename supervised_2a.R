##don't worry about that code






#########Practice questions:


####I'd like you to have experience creating documents from scratch



# 1. We originally set the proportion of the training set to be .8 --- what happens to performance when we set it at .2? Re-run all the code 
#after that point (with smoothing)

#Accuracy, recall, and precision all go down. 
##Baseline Accuracy:  0.5916151 
##Accuracy: 0.9273111 
##Recall: 0.9184298 
##Precision: 0.9569721 
##F1-score: 0.9373049


# 2. Read the help file about textmodel_nb . What does the "prior" argument do in Naive Bayes? What is the default value for this 
# argument in quanteda?

#The prior argument assigns either the uniform, docfreq, or termfreq distribution to the training classes, which affect the calculation of the fitted probabilities.
#The default in quanteda for prior is uniform priors, which sets the unconditional probability of observing the one class to be the same as observing any other class.


#3. Re-run the code with prior = "docfreq". Think about the proportions of classes in the dataset. How should this affect your outcome?
# Looking at the results of the code, were you right?

#Assigning the document frequency prior distribution means that the class priors will be taken from the relative proportions of the class documents used in the training set.
#This should make accuracy, recall, and precision all go down.
##Baseline Accuracy:  0.5916151 
##Accuracy: 0.9214296 
##Recall: 0.9181331 
##Precision: 0.9473684 
##F1-score: 0.9325217
